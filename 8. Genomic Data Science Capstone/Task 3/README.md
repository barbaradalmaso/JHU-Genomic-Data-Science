# Peer-graded Assignment: QC the Alignment

## Instructions
Now you have aligned the data, the next step is to do some quality control to make sure that the data are in good shape. 
You can use FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) to perform these analyses. 
As an aside, the FastQC team have recently started a very interesting blog on QC for genomics: QCFail (https://sequencing.qcfail.com/). 
In addition to the above questions use this document: http://bioinfo-core.org/index.php/9th_Discussion-28_October_2010 to determine if any of the other QC metrics look strange for specific samples. 
If there are any major problems with specific samples, include a variable in your phenotype table as defined in the previous assessment.

## Review criteria

Upload a pdf document (at most 2 pages) with a description and results of your QC analysis. At minimum it must include the percentage of reads mapped for each sample and whether the different age groups have different mapping rates and the average quality score of mapped reads.

* Does the document appear to have an appropriate QC?
* Does the percentage of mapped reads seem appropriate?
* Is the mapping rates similar for fetal and adult samples?
* Is there a trend in the average quality score of mapped reads?
