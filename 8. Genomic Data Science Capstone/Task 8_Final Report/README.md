# Peer-graded Assignment: Describe Your Analysis

## Introduction
The next step is to document your work. One of the major issues in genomic data science is that there are so many steps in the process. If these steps are not documented well the result can be major problems. One extreme example is a case where a non-reproducible analysis resulted in clinical trials that may have been assigning patients the wrong therapy (to learn more about that extreme case, see: http://simplystatistics.org/2012/02/27/the-duke-saga-starter-set/). In this assessment you need to document every step of your analysis. You should include where you obtained all of your data, how you obtained it, every piece of software, every parameter, and every analysis that you performed. For some parts of the analysis it may be useful to use Rmarkdown or Jupyter notebooks to contain your analysis code.

## Review Criteria
Please upload a pdf document (no more than 5 pages) detailing your entire software and statistical analysis pipeline. Please make sure you include every piece of software you used, all versions, and all commands you ran. The ideal thing would be to use a literate programming approach such as Rmarkdown or Jupyter notebooks, but regardless be very detailed in your report.

* Did they upload a document with their analysis pipeline?
* Did it include all parameter settings they used for all software they used?
* Did it include al commands that were used to produce the results?
* Do you feel that you could exactly perform their analysis using the instructions in this document?
