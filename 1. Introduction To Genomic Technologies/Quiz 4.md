* Multiple testing correction
* Using linear models
```
Answer: Randomization
```

## Question 10
Which of the following are benefits of making big data as small as possible as soon as possible?
* Interactive analysis can improve our ability to make discoveries
* Reduced data will increase the power of statistical tests
* Smaller data sets will decrease false discovery rates
