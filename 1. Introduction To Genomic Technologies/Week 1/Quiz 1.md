Answer: Producing all the proteins that a person requires for life
```

# Question 10
One major difference between humans and bacteria is
* Human cells contain separate organelles called mitochondria, and bacterial cells do not
* The human genome is made of DNA, while bacteria are made of RNA
* Human genes are first transcribed to RNA, while bacterial genes are not
* Human proteins are made of combinations of 20 amino acids, while bacterial proteins use a smaller set of 12 amino acids
```
Answer: Human cells contain separate organelles called mitochondria, and bacterial cells do not
