## Question 1
Genome assembly refers to
* The process whereby a cell copies its DNA
* A computational method for reconstructing chromosomes from short reads
* A computational process to translate high level code into machine level instructions
* A computational method to identify the genes being expressed in a cell or tissue
```
Answer: The process whereby a cell copies its DNA
```

## Question 2
Which of the following is not true about DNA?

* It doesn’t matter which direction you write the sequence in
* Each strand has a direction
* One strand is complementary to the other
```
Answer: It doesn’t matter which direction you write the sequence in
```

## Question 3
