# Quiz 3: Computating Technology

## Question 1
A computer algorithm is
* A description of the hardware and software capabilities of a computer
* A description of the memory organization within a computer
* A protocol for transmitting data over a network
* A precise specification of all the steps needed to compute a solution to a problem
```
Answer: A precise specification of all the steps needed to compute a solution to a problem
```

## Question 2
You can make a program more efficient by
* Re-designing the algorithm to require fewer steps
* Recompiling it on a different computer
* Running it on the Amazon cloud
* Replacing your hard drives with faster solid state drives
```
Answer: Re-designing the algorithm to require fewer steps
```

## Question 3
DNA sequences can be represented efficiently using
* The SAM alignment format
* Two bits for each of the 4 possible bases
* One codon for each amino acid
* One byte for each of the 4 possible bases
```
Answer: Two bits for each of the 4 possible bases
```

## Question 4
A programming language is
* A formal language used to instruct computers what to do
* A web-based environment for building computer programs
* Anything written in Python
* A method for translating between languages such as English and French
```
Answer: A formal language used to instruct computers what to do
```

## Question 5
Software engineering involves
* All of these options
* Updating code so that it remains compatible with other software systems.
* Testing programs on a wide range of examples to see if they perform as expected
* Debugging computer code
```
Answer: All of these options
```

## Question 6
Bowtie, TopHat, and Cufflinks are
* A suite of software tools for alignment and analysis of next-generation sequence data
* A web-based system for browsing genome data
* Programs for determining the function of a gene
* Elements of men’s formal evening wear
```
Answer: A suite of software tools for alignment and analysis of next-generation sequence data
```


## Question 7
Sequence alignment refers to
* Lining up two DNA sequences so that positions with the same base match one another
* Making sure that all the DNA sequences in a file use the same format
* Shuffling the positions in a sequence to randomize them
* Determining the amino acid sequence produced by translating a DNA sequence
```
Answer: Lining up two DNA sequences so that positions with the same base match one another
```


## Question 8
A software pipeline for RNA sequence (RNA-seq) analysis will
* Process large raw sequence files into a summary table showing which genes were present
* Create a database in which one can efficiently store and retrieve results
* Compare cases to controls and determine which genes were responsible for any differences in phenotype
* Evaluate the best RNA-seq protocol for minimizing sequencing artifacts
```
Answer:  Process large raw sequence files into a summary table showing which genes were present
```

## Question 9
Which of the following is not a computer operating system?
* Google Drive
* RedHat Linux
* Unix
* Mac OS X
```
Answer: Google Drive
```

## Question 10
A data set large enough to overwhelm the main memory of a computer would
* Be larger than the available RAM
* Contain more than one genome’s worth of data
* Use uncompressed files rather than compressed ones
* Be at least 100 gigabytes in size
```
Answer: Be larger than the available RAM
```
