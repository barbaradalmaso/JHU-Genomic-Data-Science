# Quiz 1: Introduction

## Question 1
What details do some modern papers fail to provide that inhibit reproducibility?
* Who performed the analysis
* What versions of software was used for the analysis
* Who funded the research
* Where the analysis was performed
```
Answer: What versions of software was used for the analysis
```

## Question 2
What is reproducibility?
* Provenance
* None of these options
* Correctness
* Reusability
```
Answer: None of these options
```

## Question 3
Why is reproducibility important?
* It is a requirement enforced by all peer-reviewers
* It ensures that the results of scientific research are accurate
* It is a minimum standard to allow computational research to be reviewed and inspected
* It guarantees that methods can be applied other types of analysis
```
Answer: It is a minimum standard to allow computational research to be reviewed and inspected
```

## Question 4
Which of the following might be considered necessary to increase reproducibility in modern analysis?
* All of these options
* Provide access to the primary data
* Record versions and parameters used in the analysis
* Computation should be considered an integral part of biomedical research and its methods recorded
```
Answer: All of these options
```

## Question 5
Is this challenge surmountable?
* Yes, but only by hiring a trained bioinformatician because this is all too hard for biologists
* No, the data is too large for modern systems to record
* No but reproducibility in science is a secondary concern anyway
* Yes, modern software platforms (including Galaxy) were created to help researchers meet these challenges
```
Answer: Yes, modern software platforms (including Galaxy) were created to help researchers meet these challenges
```

## Question 6
Galaxy is available as:
* As a Microsoft Surface App that is free
* As a website that is free for everyone to use
* As a complimentary service available to anyone with a subscription to Nature
* As a desktop application for around ~$99
```
Answer: As a website that is free for everyone to use
```

## Question 7
How can you extend Galaxy?
* You can write and share new tools
* Since it's open source, you can copy it and make changes to run your own Galaxy website
* All of these options
* You can contribute to the Galaxy code and documentation using github
```
Answer: All of these options
```

## Question 8
Galaxy...
* Provides unlimited compute and storage resources for free at usegalaxy.org
* Performs automated experimental design and data analysis
* Ensures that your analysis is performed correctly
* Provides an environment for researchers to easily use existing bioinformatic software and record and share the results
```
Answer: Provides an environment for researchers to easily use existing bioinformatic software and record and share the results
```

## Question 9
You need what to use the public Galaxy site usegalaxy.org?
* Large hard drives (at least 20TB)
* Your own data in XML format
* Access to your own supercomputers and at least two IT professionals
* An email account and a web browser
```
Answer: An email account and a web browser
```

## Question 10
For analysis where usegalaxy.org does not provide appropriate computation power or tools, you can:
* All of these options
* Use any of the ~60 other public Galaxy servers
* Run your own, local Galaxy server
* Run Galaxy on the Amazon Cloud
```
Answer: All of these options
```

## Question 11
Galaxy...
* Cannot be used by anyone else to start a server
* Can run as a server on Windows
* Is highly configurable for many types of compute infrastructure
* Can only work on one cluster system
```
Answer: Is highly configurable for many types of compute infrastructure
```
