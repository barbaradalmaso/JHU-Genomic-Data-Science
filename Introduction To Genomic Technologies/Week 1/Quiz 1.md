1. The central dogma of molecular biology tells us that information is passed from

**DNA to RNA to protein**
RNA to DNA to protein
DNA to methylation to RNA to protein
DNA to RNA to methylation to protein


2. Which of the following is one of the major drivers of the sequencing revolution that began after 2008?

Decreased computational analysis time
Improved Sanger sequencing
**Decreased cost of sequencing**
Increased sample collection


3. Which of the following is an exclusive characteristic of genomics compared to traditional biology?

**Studies considering the entire genome**
Targeted studies of one or a few genes
Measurements of molecules in the Central Dogma
Clever experimental design

4. Genomic data science involves techniques from which of these disciplines?

Computer Science

**All of the these options**
Statistics



5. Which of the following is an activity that genomic data scientists do not perform?

**Sample collection**
Population genomics
Experimental design
Integrative genomics



6. Which of these is not one of the DNA nucleic acids?

**Tyrosine**
Thymine
Adenine
Guanine



7. Transcription is a process that converts DNA to

genes
any other molecule
**RNA**
polymerases

8. The cost to sequence a human genome today, in U.S. dollars, is approximately

$30 million
None of these options
**$1000**
$20,000

9. DNA encodes instructions for

**Producing all the proteins that a person requires for life**
Helping us digest food
Enveloping viruses that infect a cell
Regulating body temperature

10. One major difference between humans and bacteria is

**Human cells contain separate organelles called mitochondria, and bacterial cells do not.**
The human genome is made of DNA, while bacteria are made of RNA.
Human genes are first transcribed to RNA, while bacterial genes are not.
Human proteins are made of combinations of 20 amino acids, while bacterial proteins use a smaller set of 12 amino acids.
