## Question 4
Which of the following operations of quality control can be performed with Galaxyâ€™s NGS: QC and manipulation?
* FastQC: Read Quality reports
* Trim Sequences
* All of these options
* FASTA to FASTQ, and FASTQ to FASTA format conversion, Manipulate FASTQ

```

## Question 5
Which of the following is NOT part of the FastQC report?
* Per sequence base quality
* Per sequence quality score
* Sequence Length distribution
* Per base sequence quality
```
Answer: Yes, modern software platforms (including Galaxy) were created to help researchers meet these challenges
```

## Question 6
When do we filter and trim reads? Choose the correct option.
* Always filter reads. We want only high quality reads in our data.
* Always filter and trim reads, we want high quality equal length reads to gain flexibility of using any tool of choice during downstream analysis.
* Depends on tools used during downstream analysis.
* Always trim the reads. We want only equal length reads in our data.

## Question 7
What is ChIP sequencing most commonly used to measure?
* Ratios of miRNA to DNA
* Methylation of bases
* The locations of protein to DNA interaction
* Expression levels of particular proteins
```
Answer: All of these options
```

## Question 8
What is MACS used for?
* Measure RNA levels
* Peak calling/reconstruction from ChIP-seq data
* Genome assembly using suffix trees and ChIP-seq data
* Detect sequence variants using both qPCR and ChIP-seq data
```
Answer: Provides an environment for researchers to easily use existing bioinformatic software and record and share the results
```

## Question 9
What is the advantage of using a control in a ChIP sequencing experiment?
* Both options
* Allow MACS to calculate FDR.
* Determine background expectation of the number of peaks detected.
* Neither option
